jenkins ===>> CI / CD tool.

continueos intergration and continueos deployment tool.

jenkins is automation tool.

jenkins port number ==>> 8080

/etc/sysconfig/jenkins

jenkins ===>>> to overcome water fall model and agile methodologies ( draw backs / manual ) ===>> jenkins ( automation)..

Jenkins is the heart of the devops ..

we will integrate with all devops tools with jenkins and deploy the applications..==>> dev / Qa / uat / prod.

jenkins ==>> jobs create ==>> run ==>> build.

jenkins ==>> we have two types of jobs.

1. free style jobs ( jenkins dash board ===>>> GUI )

2. Pipeline jobs.. ( jenkins dash board ===>>> Groovy script and github ==>> jenkinsfile)

jenkins ===>> plugins ==>>> install ===>> extranal features adding to our jenkins dashboard.

jenkins ===>> plugins ==>>> 3 ways to install..

jenkins ==>> build triggers ===>> pollscm , build periodically ( cron expression ), webhooks..

jenkins ==>> all devops tool integrate with jenkins.

jenkins ==>>>> we will create parameterized jobs..

jenkins ==>>> sequential jobs ( upstream and downstream jobs) and parallel jobs..

jenkins ===>>> master / slave architecture.

jenkins ==>>> backup

jenkins ==>>> security.

jenkins ==>>> users to create.

jenkins ==>> upgrade.

jenkins ==>> automate with the help of jobs..

Jenkins ==>>> important configuration files..

1. jenkins home directory : /var/lib/jenkins.

2. installed plugins : /var/lib/jenkins/plugins

3. created jobs list : /var/lib/jenkins/workspace

4. nodes information : /var/lib/jenkins/nodes

5. jenkins logs information : /var/lib/jenkins/logs

6. list of jobs ==>> /var/lib/jenkins/jobs

7. created users list : /var/lib/jenkins/users.

Jenkins installation steps :

1. we need to take one ec2 instance and login into that ec2 instance.

2. java install

3. git install

4. maven install

5. jenkins install ( 4 steps)

6. start the jenkins service ==>>> service jenkins start

7. jenkins ec2instance==>> publicip:8080(  browser) ==>>> enter

8. jenkins dash board ==>> display ==>> path /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialadminpasswd ===>>> copy this path

9. go to jenkins ec2 instace ==>>> cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialadminpasswd ==>> enter ===>> encrypted password ==>> copy

10. paste it into jenkins dashboard ==>> box .

11. select suggested plugins ==>> click

12. username , password , conformpassword , email ===>> continure ==>> your jenkins dashboard is ready..

=================================================================================================================================

Automation project 1:

1. we need to create one ec2 instance and login into that ec2 instance===>> install tomcat.

2. we need to install deploy to container plugin in jenkins dashboard.( war file copy ==>>> source to destination)

3. create a jenkins job in jenkins dashboard.

===================================================================================================

pollscm : cron expression

build periodically : cron expression

webhooks : triggering concept ===>> we will create webhooks in github ===>> webhooks ==>> jenkins url ==>> event ==>> developer ==>> any modification ==>>> build trigger ==>> deployemnt..

********difference between pollscm ,buildperodically , webhooks..

build periodically ==>> cron expression based ==>> schedule ==>> developer modify / un modify ==>>> automatically jobs ==>> build ==>>> deployments ==>>> jenkins instance ==>> CPU / DISK / MEMORY / NETWORK utilization increase ==>> jenkins instance hung state.

poll scm :==>> cron expression based ==>> schedule ==>> developer modify ==>>> automatically jobs ==>> build ==>>> deployments.

webhooks : event based ==>> developer ==>> any modification ==>> imediately action will takes palce.==>> jobs run ==>> deployments..

How to change jenkins port number ??

vi /etc/sysconfig/jenkins ===>> jenkins_port = 8080 ( 2005)

service jenkins stop

service jenkins start

==================================================================

parameterized builds :

we need to install git parameter plugin install..

senario :

developer ==>>> request raise to ops team ( ours)

can you please test the war file is generated or not  in dev / master / feture branch ??

========================================================================================================

sequential jobs / upstream and downstream jobs :

joba ==>> jobb ==>>> jobc ==>> continueosly loop.

Based on sequential jobs / upstream and downstream jobs  ===>>> visualization different.

we need to install two plugins..

1. buildpipeline plugin 

2. delivery pipeline plugin.

sequential jobs / upstream and downstream jobs ==>> continueosly loop.

jenkins instance ===>> CPU / DISK / MEMORY / NETWORK  utilization increase ==>> jenkins instance ==>>> hung state.

To over come above senario then parallel jobs came into the picture.

parallel jobs :

we need to install multi job plugin.

plugins extension ==>> .jpi or .hpi format
